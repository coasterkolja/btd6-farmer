# BTD6 Farmer
A Bot that farms collection events on expert maps with bonus rewards

Note that the scrip currently only works in fullscreen on a screen-resolution of 1900 x 1200.
I haven't yet tested other screen sizes nor have I created the playthroughs for them.

# Usage
- diconnect your device from the internet otherwise it will get interupted by the "Open Box"-screen and cease to work
- start your game and go to the Lobby
- run the following command:
```
python main.py
```
- focus the Game-Window again within 2 seconds

Now the Bot will start farming.
To stop it just close the terminal thats running it
